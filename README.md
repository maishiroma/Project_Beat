# Project Beat
This contains the source code for my POC project, tenatively called Project Beat. 

## Project Goals
1. Create a prototype as rapid as possible
2. Take advantage of free assets
3. Leverage good coding practices and game making practices

## Summary

I am only using these mediums to help push my coding experience to the next level. I will not sell this project or market anything in this game that I did not create on my own as my own. I will make sure all credit is given to whom it is necessary.
